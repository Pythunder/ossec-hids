OSSEC Hids Logging

== Introduction ==

The system supports two types of logs. Alert logging and event
or archive logging. 

Every message received is treated as an event. 
Any log message, integrity report, system information will be treated 
as such. Event logging is very expensive for the system because
it will archive every event. However, they can be usefull to get
the big picture if some attack happens.

Alert logging is the most usefull one. An alert is generated when
an event is matched against one of the detection rules. Besides 
logging, OSSEC hids also supports email notifications and external
command execution as an alert method.


== Event logging ==

Inside the OSSEC default loggings directory (by default /var/ossec/logs) 
there is an entry for "archives" (/var/ossec/logs/archives). Inside this
directory, all events will be stored by date.
For example, all events received on May 22 of 2004, will be stored on:

/var/ossec/logs/archives/2004/May/events-22.log

After each day, a hash will be created for this specific day at

/var/ossec/logs/archives/2004/May/events-22.log.md5

This hash will be the hash of the file from the day 22 plus the hash
from the day 21.

The hash from the day 1, will be the hash from the day 31 (or 30 or 28)
from the previous month.

This will ensure that no log will be modified. Also, for this to happen,
all the logs (since the first day) will need to be modified.


== Alert logging ==

There will be a "alerts" directory on the OSSEC default logging directory.
It will be organized on the same way the event logging is. Please read
above to understand it.
