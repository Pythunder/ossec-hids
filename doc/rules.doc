--- Rules Organization ---


-- Classification --

The rules are classified in multiple levels. From the lowest (00) to the maximum
level 16. Some levels are not used right now. Other levels can be added between
them or after them. 

**The rules will be read from the highest to the lowest level. **

00 - Ignore the log if matched (to avoid false positives -- no action taken).
01 - "Bad word" matching. Include words like "bad", "error", etc.
02 - ** Unused **
03 - System notification messages (no security importance).
04 - ** Unused ** 
05 - System low importance errors (including bad configuration, etc).
06 - Important system notification messages.
07 - User caused errors (missed password, bad username, denied action, etc).
08 - Medium importancy error/warning messages.
09 - ** Unused **
10 - Repeatedly user caused errors (can be an attack, multiple bad passwords, etc).
11 - High importance notification or error messages.
12 - Unusual (important) message. Probably matches an unknown security event.
13 - Important (known) security event.
14 - ** Unused **
15 - Urgent security event (can not be a false positive).
16 - High urgent (critical) security event (uh-oh,).
